Cheat for one minute timed test. ~150 WPM &amp; ~100% Acc. This was developed for educational and experimental reasons only, if you want to use it for more that is your own choice. I am not responsible for what you do with this project in any way.

# How To Use
To use you must download the main python file.
After downloading the file you must get the latest edge or chrome web driver, links below:

[Edge WebDriver Download](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)

[Chrome WebDriver Download](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)

You must move the web driver exe file into the same folder as the python file, You also need to update the name of the driver inside the python file like so:
```
webdriver_location="<exe_file_name_here>"
```

If you are using chrome instead of edge you also need to change the following lines from:
```
options=EdgeOptions()
options.use_chromium=True
options.binary_location=r'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe'
browser=Edge(options=options,executable_path=webdriver_location)
```
To:
```
options=webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.use_chromium=True
options.binary_location=r'C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe'
browser=webdriver.Chrome(options=options,executable_path=webdriver_location)
```

# If You Want To Copy
I'm not going to be upset if you copy my code, its open source for a reason. Just give credit where its desired. If you want to work together on a project feel free to reach out to me. I'm often bored and looking for a project.
